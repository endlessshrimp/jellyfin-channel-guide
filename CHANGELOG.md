# Changelog

## v0.1.4

- Filter box in the top bar (or press /): narrows the grid to channels whose
  name/number matches or that air a matching show; matching shows are
  highlighted. Esc clears the filter, a second Esc closes the guide.
- Trackpad/wheel now scrolls the grid smoothly like a normal list, without
  moving the selection. Arrow keys still move the highlight and keep it in
  view; Page Up/Down jump a screen.

## v0.1.3

- Wheel/trackpad scrolling pages the grid 5 channels (one screen) at a time,
  keeping the highlight in the same spot; one swipe = one page.

## v0.1.2

- Mouse wheel / trackpad scrolling moves one channel per notch-sized chunk
  with a short cooldown, instead of one channel per wheel event.

## v0.1.1

- Jellyfin's own Live TV → Guide tab now opens Channel Guide instead of the
  stock grid. Closing it returns to Live TV → Programs; Back from a channel you
  started returns to the guide.
- Hovering with the mouse only highlights; the grid no longer scrolls under the
  pointer. Arrow keys and the wheel scroll only when the selection leaves view.

## v0.1.0 (2026-09-12)

First release of the full-screen guide.

- Full-screen, set-top-box style guide on a 1920×1080 stage that scales to the
  window: program info panel, preview window, three-hour channel grid with a
  "now" marker, remote-style key legend.
- Loads on every Jellyfin Web page without opening anything. Adds a **Guide**
  button to the header for signed-in users and opens on the **G** key. The
  button reattaches when Jellyfin redraws its header, and loading the script
  twice doesn't add a second one.
- **OK / Enter** or a click starts the channel in the same browser tab.
- **R** schedules a one-time recording of the selected program and shows a
  confirmation. Programs with a scheduled recording get a red dot.
- The OK, Record and Exit hints along the bottom are clickable, so the guide can
  be closed without a keyboard.
- Closes when Jellyfin navigates to another page.
- Sends Jellyfin Web's own client/device details with API requests, so using the
  guide doesn't rename the browser in Jellyfin's device list or create an extra
  session.
- `window.ChannelGuide.open()` / `.close()` for scripting.

`theme.css`, the earlier CSS-only restyle of Jellyfin's built-in guide page, is
still in the repo but is no longer the main product.
